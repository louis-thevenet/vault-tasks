## üîç What is Entropy?

Entropy is a fundamental concept in thermodynamics that quantifies the amount of disorder or randomness in a system. It reflects the number of microscopic configurations that correspond to a thermodynamic system's macroscopic state.

- [x] Review the definition of entropy in the textbook (Chapter 1) #reading p2
      From Chapter 1, section 1.3. Statistical mechanics perspective

  - [x] Read section 1.3 on statistical interpretation
  - [x] Highlight key formulas
  - [x] Take notes in margin

- [x] Summarize the key points about entropy in your own words #revision p3
      Turn notes into a summary paragraph
  - [x] Write a paragraph summary
  - [x] Compare entropy in gases vs solids
  - [x] Add summary to knowledge base

## üìà The Second Law of Thermodynamics

The second law states that the total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease over time. This implies that natural processes tend to move towards a state of maximum entropy.

- [x] Find real-world examples illustrating the second law of thermodynamics #examples
      Three clear examples needed

  - [x] Melting ice cube
  - [x] Gas expansion in vacuum
  - [x] Heat transfer between bodies

- [ ] Create a diagram showing entropy increase in a closed system #visual c60 p1 friday
      Use drawing software and add a caption
  - [ ] Sketch on paper
  - [/] Redraw neatly in drawing software c60
    Still needs arrows
  - [-] Add caption and explanation
    Will skip this part for now
